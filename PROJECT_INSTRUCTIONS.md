You are building this app from scratch. There is NO Base44 usage.

Tech stack:
- React + Vite + TypeScript

Hard requirements:
- The entire UI must be in Hebrew only (no English in UI strings).
- Full RTL layout across the entire app.
- Production-grade code quality: clean architecture, small components, strict typing.
- No backend for now. Use a local Mock API layer.

Workflow rules:
- Do not explore or modify files unless explicitly asked.
- Work in small steps. Summarize files changed after each step.
- Ask questions only if a requirement blocks implementation.
